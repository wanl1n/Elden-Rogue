QUESTLINE: TWINKLE TOES

Hi, traveller! I'm Fleta Harrisone. I heard you were going on an adventure. Would you mind doing something for me while you're out there? I'll give you 100 runes for it.

	[1] Sure, what is it?
	[0] Not up for it, sorry.

[1]
	Great! Here's the deal. Recently, the creatures in the Stormveil Castle have been loud and I can't sleep at all! I would really appreciate if you can get rid of at least 5 of them, but if you wanna kill more of them that would be great too.

[0]
	Aw that sucks. Well, it's fine. I wish you safe travels and if you ever feel like you might be up for it, I'll be here!

	[1] Alright, I'll take you up on that.
	[0] Eh... that's too much for me.

[1]
	Thanks for accepting my request! I wish you safe travels and success in your journey ahead.

[0]
	Oh, that's okay. I understand. Best of luck in your travels!


QUEST STARTED: TWINKLE TOES I

	[0] Thanks!

[In progress]
Still waiting for you to kill 5 creatures from Stormveil Castle. Really looking forward to a good sleep soon.

[Completed]
Thank you so much! I've been sleeping wayyy better now thanks to you. 
Here's 100 runes as promised! If you're up for it, I actually have 
another request. I'll give you 200 runes this time.

	[1] Sure, I gotchu.
	[0] Nah, one's enough.

[1]
	Okay so I've been walking past the Raya Lucaria Academy and I've noticed how messy that place is. Can you possibly clear up some space there? Around 7 tiles should be good. I'm too scared to go in but perhaps it'd make the place look cleaner.

[0]
	Can't be helped. Someone like you must be busy with other things. That's perfectly okay. See you around and I hope you come back safe! If you ever change your mind, I'm right here.

	[1] I'll help.
	[0] You don't need me for that.

[1]
	You're such a dear for that! This whole place honestly needs a little revamp and you are making it much easier for us. Thank you!

[0]
	Oh, well an extra hand never hurt anyone. But if you're too busy, that's fine. Best of luck in your travels!

You getting around to clearing out 7 tiles in the Raya Lucaria Academy? No rush.

[Completed]
You're so sweet. Thanks for going out of your way to do this. I already feel the change in atmosphere. Here's your 200 runes! By the way, if you're up for it, there's just one more thing I need. I'll give you something special.

	[1] What is it?
	[0] Sorry, I can't right now.

[1]
	Yay! So, the big guy at Redmane Castle, Starscourge Radahn? Yeah, he's been pestering me lately. Not sure why. If you can put him in his place,	I'd appreciate it so much!

[0]
	Oh, okay. But if you ever feel like hearing me out, do come by again!

	[1] Oh, him? Sure, that's too easy.
	[0] Ah... I don't think I can.

[1]
	You are a godsend. I hope you shut that dude up once and for all. Thanks!

[0]
	Oh, I understand. Facing him might be quite intimidating. That's alright!
	Safe travels to you, traveller!

QUEST STARTED: TWINKLE TOES III

	[0] I'll be back.

[In Progress]
I know you have a lot on your plate, and I appreciate you agreeing to defeat the Starscourge Radahn in the Redmane Castle.

[Completed]
You are amazing! Thanks for defeating that weird guy. Honestly, the world is so much better without him. Anyway, as promised, you can take this. I was once an adventurer like you, until I took an arrow to the knee. But this really helped me in my travels and I hope it does the same for you!

SWIFT SLIPPER acquired.
