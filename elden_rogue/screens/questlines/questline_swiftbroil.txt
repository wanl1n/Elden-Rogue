QUESTLINE: SWIFT BROIL

Greetings, weary traveler. I know you but you don't know me, I'm Hilda Aytone. A little birdie told me you were leaving soon for an adventure. Do you mind if I make a request? I'll give you 200 runes for it!

	[1] Sure, what is it?
	[0] Not up for it, sorry.

[1]
	Fleta and I have been arguing a lot about how strong the creatures are. I've been saying they're easy peasy lemon squeezy but she's utterly scared of them. Can you defeat one of them without using potions?

[0]
	Oh, that's fine. If you ever have some time, do come by!

	[1] Alright, I'll take you up on that.
	[0] Eh... that's too much for me.

[1]
	Sounds great! I'll be awaiting your good news.

[0]
	I guess it just isn't my day today.


QUEST STARTED: SWIFT BROIL I

	[0] Thanks!

[In progress]
Hey, you get around to killing a creature without using potions yet? Fleta's just not budging.

[Completed]
Ha! I knew they were small fries. *BARK* Thanks for accepting my request! *BARK* Actually, I've got another if *BARK* you're interested. This time it's a serious *BARK* request. I'll give you 500 runes for it *BARK*.

	[1] Sure, I gotchu.
	[0] Nah, one's enough.

[1]
	Great! *BARK* Well, I have a dog, *BARK* I'm sure you heard him, his name is Khloe, *BARK* and he's been barking a *BARK* lot lately because the creatures have been *BARK* multipying a LOT *BARK* recently. I would be so grateful *BARK* if you could defeat at least 10 of them. I just want a *BARK* peaceful day without constant barking. 

[0]
	Oh, well *BARK* if you're ever *BARK* up for it, I'm always here. *BARK*

	[1] I'll help.
	[0] You don't need me for that.

[1]
	Khloe and I *BARK* are awaiting your great news. Really *BARK* looking forward to that.

[0]
	Oh *BARK* okay. Better luck next time I guess. *BARK*

QUEST STARTED: SWIFT BROIL II

[In Progress]
Anytime now *BARK* would be great *BARK*. Just defeat 10 *BARK* creatures. That's all.

[Completed]
Ahh... Finally, some peace of mind. Thank you so much! Here's your 500 runes! If you want you can pet Khloe! :)

	[1] What is it?
	[0] Sorry, I can't right now.

[1]
	*HAPPY BARK* He says thank you! By the way, one more thing. I'll give you a special weapon I've got if you help me defeat Morgott the Omen King. His aura's been seeping out lately and it's bothering all of us here. Can you do it?

[0]
	Oh, that's fine. Not all people like dogs but nevertheless we're grateful.

	[1] Oh, him? Sure, that's too easy.
	[0] Ah... I don't think I can.

[1]
	I have full confidence in you! Khloe and I will be waiting for your good news right here!

[0]
	Ah, that's alright. If you think you can do it, do drop by again.

QUEST STARTED: SWIFT BROIL III

	[0] I'll be back.

[In Progress]
Morgott's aura is still lingering. I hope you defeat him soon. It's time for a little cleansing in the Leyndell Capital.

[Completed]
WOW! You're awesome! *BARK BARK* Khloe says you're the best! Thanks as always. Here, this weapon has helped me punish some... bad boys and girls. Take it and whip some discipline into those creatures!

GIANT'S BELT acquired.
